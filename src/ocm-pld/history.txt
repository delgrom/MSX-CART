v3.x KdL/HRA's Unofficial Release \______________________________________________________________________________


v3.7.1 [2019.05.20] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated the RTCSAVE tool to Revision 3.0 in the [msxtools\rtcsave\] folder,
  a fixed version of the RTCSETUP.ASC demo example has been moved here from OCM-EXTRA Pack.
- Updated 'vgmplay.com' v1.3-rc4 in the [msxtools\vgmplay\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware, implemented the use of any version of Quartus II.
- New contents inside the [msxtools\] folder, MSX COMMANDER v1.1.05 and the ZEXALL tool.
- Improved VDP wait controller for greater game compatibility (games like Breaker and RADX-8 are playable now).
- Fixed a bug of line buffer for VGA upscan converter, this was causing a limit of 4096 colors in the VGA output.
- Restored the reset control in the T80 core, all removed signals have been reworked upstream.
- Regression in luminance calibration to improve the color scale of YJK modes (1chipMSX only).
- In this release all Zemmix Neo firmwares are interchangeable with each other.

Notes and warnings:
- Some firmware may not be as stable as others. When necessary, I suggest trying another keyboard layout.
- In case the SD-Card is not detected after a hard reset, simply reinsert it on the fly to solve.
- Nextor kernel for OCM is unable to flash the PLD firmware using 'pldload.com' and the machine can be BRICKED!!
  From 'pldflash.com' v1.5 and later Unsupported Kernels are automatically detects, pay close attention to this.
- The most of Microcabin games can run better with the 'runit.com' tool, with 'ep.com' two drives are required.
- Most of the features of the MSX turbo-R have not yet been developed and are for testing purposes only.

Some known issues:
- The sprites disable and enable after three lines instead of after one line, reported by Grauw and Andre.
- The game Fighter's Ragnarok has all the damaged graphics, a bug in the VDP command engine should be the cause.
- Some PSG sounds are not played accurately and sometimes the OPLL drum kit sounds too loud.
- The 'Break' command of ESE-PS2 module do not work during the hard reset or if you unplug the keyboard at warm.
- The current version of MSX turbo-R BIOS can be started with Internal Mapper 4096 kB only using Nextor kernel
  and generates some issues with the PSG output (simply just listen to the beep sound to confirm it).

v3.7 [2019.04.15] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 9:
  new Linear support for the Internal Slot-1 and Slot-2 (games like "Tina's Adventure Island" are playable now),
  thanks to Sebbeug for testing and suggesting its implementation.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder.
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v2.0370b (2019.04.12) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- Updated 'vgmplay.com' v1.3-rc3 in the [msxtools\vgmplay\] folder.
- Updated 'z80_and_r800_opcodes_list.pdf' v1.10 by GDX in the [esemsx3\src\cpu\opcodes\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware, including support for Windows 10 October 2018.
- New contents inside the [msxtools\] folder, some FlashAir tools by Yuukun.
- New setup for TimeQuest Timing Analyser, in collaboration with György.
- Improved the overall stability of firmware by removing all the latches, by György.
  The warning log has been reduced to around 30/35 messages, a negligible value compared to the previous 105/110.
- Improved detection of the SD-Card that sometimes failed, by György.
- Fixed a minor issue in joystick port 2 related to pin-3 management.
- Cleaned up the source code from parts of unused code and fixed some inaccuracies in the comments.
- In this release all Zemmix Neo firmwares are interchangeable with each other.


v3.6.2 [2018.07.27] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 8:
  added some vertical offsets useful for centering games like Ark-A-Noah and Space Manbow (scmd-$47..$4F).
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder.
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v1.9e in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware, including support for the SX-1 board.
- Updated English keyboard layout by adding optional scancode $61 '\|'.
- Fixed the playability of ANMA games by improving the accuracy of the H-SYNC signal, thanks to Andre.
- In this release all Zemmix Neo firmwares are interchangeable with each other.

v3.6.1 [2018.06.03] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) datasheet and DIP-SW User Manual in the [docs\] folder with some news:
  now the VGA mode is the new output for LED TVs or LED displays and the VGA+ mode is the legacy output,
  the new scmd-$81/$82 can exchange the two VGA modes to better manage the Zemmix Neo hardware scanlines;
  the trick "Pixel Ratio 1:1 for VGA Output" has been replaced with the new "Pixel Ratio 1:1 for LED Display".
- Updated 'mglocm.com' (2018.06.03) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware to improve multi-release stability.
- Added 'stability_tests.ods' to the [firmware\] folder, a simple procedure to better test all firmware variants.
- Fixed an overscan PAL mode issue by improving the accuracy of the H-SYNC signal, thanks to Grauw.
- In this release all Zemmix Neo firmwares are back to being interchangeable with each other.

v3.6 [2018.05.14] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 7:
  new audio presets "Emphasis PSG Sound", "Emphasis SCC-I Sound" and "Emphasis OPLL Sound" (scmd-$44/$45/$46),
  new SHIFT-PGUP/PGDOWN keys to do the fast switch of master volume from max level to middle, min and mute level,
  new "Pixel Ratio 1:1 for VGA Output" (scmd-$7F) a trick to get the correct pixel ratio on a non-CRT display
  (e.g. A:\>SETSMART -7F7F7F7F is fine for a VX2835WM), fixed scmd-$F9 to allow the use of an external FM-PAC,
  new scmd-$D6/D7 that allow to force the centering of YJK modes and R25 mask (useful for MSX2+ games).
- Updated DIP-SW User Manual in the [docs\] folder.
- New 'mglocm.com' and 'mglunch.com' (2017.11.18) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- New audio mixer that improve the amplitude of internal sounds and balance the input line of external slots:
  global audio starts at level 10 out of 13 to avoid clipping for at least two internal chips at a time;
  to reduce the audio noise, I suggest setting everything to the max level and an external mixer volume of 80%.
- Improved timings of VDP command engine, the intros of Fray and Space Manbow are okay now but I emphasize that
  the wait control does not calculate the actual times of the VDP commands, which still makes it inaccurate.
- Improved VGA output to help directly set a pixel ratio 1:1 on a LED TV at 60Hz (also w/o the trick scmd-$7F).
- Added MULUB and MULUW opcodes inside T80 Core: MSX turbo-R BIOS is required to use them, by TobiFlex.
- Fixed random sprites during the blank screen (ref. Manbow 2) and fixed H-SYNC signal (ref. Unknown Reality).
- Fixed the border color of YJK modes (SCREEN 10, 11 and 12) that should has been palettized.
- Fixed the horizontal position of YJK modes by +4 pixels on the right.
- In this release NOT all Zemmix Neo firmwares are interchangeable with each other, a special note is with them.


v3.5 [2017.10.10] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 6:
  added Slot-0 Primary Mode signal to the smart commands, useful to disable FM-BIOS or to run some old games.
- Updated DIP-SW User Manual in the [docs\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware.
- New ESE-MegaSCC+ 1024kB for the Slot-1, shared with the 2nd half of ESE-MegaSCC+ Slot-2.

v3.4 [2017.09.18] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 5:
  Right Inverse Audio is a good solution for recording really clean balanced audio, suggested by Grauw.
- Updated documentation and DIP-SW User Manual in the [docs\] folder.
- Updated all scripts to compile and collect firmware and added new ones to better manage the multi-release.
- New generation of Hex-files 304kB from OCM-SDBIOS Pack v2.0
- New IPL-ROM Revision 2.00 that loads 304kB EPBIOS or 512kB SDBIOS with autodetection of JIS-ROM and F4 Device.
- New method to improve the system boot time... I am very proud of this result!
- New contents inside the [msxtools\] folder, RTC save v2.2 with source code, new JIS Table and SwapEIDI tools.
- Added support to Nextor kernel, MSX turbo-R BIOS and JIS 2nd level: a proper SDBIOS is required for them.
- Bug fixes and improvements on Internal Mapper 2048 kB, Kanji ROM controller, Hard Reset Key lock and I/O ports.
- New optimization trick which gives a big reduction of 5% in Logic Elements.
- The default synthesis settings have been reset to "Area" and "Normal compilation".
- There are many PLDs in this package, choose the one you like from the [firmware\] folder.

Notes and warnings:
- The main intent of this release is to open the road for OCM to evolve in a MSX turbo-R machine and which is why
  I deliberately avoided the addition of less-used new components (ESE-RAMdisk, RS-232 and MOUSE PS/2 adapter).
- OCM-SDBIOS v1.9.2 or earlier is no longer supported by now and OCM-SDBIOS v2.0 or later is needed to have fun.

- New Hex-files 304kB from OCM-SDBIOS Pack v1.9.2 with MSX3 Final Release and Zemmix Neo logos.
  "UK layout with backslash" is the default profile from now.
- New 'pld_collector.cmd' script, a simple collector tool for testing more PLDs.
- Fixed access to port $40 for external cartridges, thanks to WORP3.
- The default synthesis settings have been set to "Balanced" and "Extra effort", suggested by Fabio Belavenuto.

Notes:
- The Nextor kernel will be natively supported by future releases.
- Sometimes random glitches or other strange issues could be caused by the optimizations of Quartus II.
  In these situations it is suggested to recompile the project by replacing 'emsx_top.qsf' (balanced technique)
  with the alternive 'emsx_top.qsf.area'.
- Some games go to black screen using 'ep.com'. I suggest to enable two disk drives via 'eset.com' and retry.

v3.3.2 [2017.03.27] [KdL's Updates!]

  All the "custom speed" frequencies were acquired with a comparison benchmark through blueMSX and openMSX.
- The initial VDP-V9938 core is finally deprecated since the VDP-TH9958 has achieved the same stability.

A known issue:
